# Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: progress

## Native / emulated

- The board (`cps3recomp/machine`): own code, no emulator. SH-2 from satrecomp (interpreter only so far).
- Picture: own software renderer (`cps3recomp/video/renderer.cpp`), MAME's drawing rules.
- Sound: own 16-voice mixer (`cps3recomp/sound/pcm.cpp`), not listened to yet.
- Frontend: cps2recomp's port/ (window, SDL_GPU presenter, shaders, menu, HUD, zoom, bindings, netplay, run-ahead,
  save states) on the board through `runtime/system.h`; recomp-common's launcher (`cps3recomp/launcher`).
- Not yet: translation of the SH-2 code (a branch is in progress), training mode (fight/), widescreen, custom
  soundtrack, Linux/Windows builds.

## Game facts

- Set `sfiii3n` (Japan 990608, NO CD). Program: cartridge ROM (BIOS, 512 KB) + SIMM 1-2 (16 MB, the game's code
  runs from 0x06000000). Graphics and samples: SIMM 3-6 (64 MB).
- Cipher keys: found from the set at load (`machine/crypt.cpp`), never stored.
- The BIOS checks each program SIMM's flash ID (04 / AD) with the SH-2's DMA from the cache-through mirror
  0x26000000; the DMA reads past the cipher.

- Credits: byte 02007CE0 (free_play keeps it at 2). Round clock: byte 02011377 (seconds; infinite_time).
- The DMA-done interrupt (level 10) drives the game's queue of character and palette DMAs (handler 060004D0 calls
  06138230: state word 0207603C, queues at 0207803C / 0207844C). Its timing matters: with the board's clock read
  stale inside a CPU slice the queue stuck and the fighters were never loaded.

- Training aids (games/sfiii3/src/training.cpp, on cps3recomp/fight/): refill health, full meter, hit boxes, input
  display. The player records, boxes, camera and meter places are facts from Grouflon's 3rd_training_lua (no licence:
  facts only, no code), made for the 990512 set; life and positions checked on this 990608 set, the rest seen to
  work in a fight's pictures only.

## Gotchas

- Addresses 0x2xxxxxxx are the cache-through mirror of 0x0xxxxxxx: main RAM is reached at 0x22000000 too.
- Interrupts are levels 12 (vertical blank) and 10 (palette/character DMA done), auto-vectored, held until
  acknowledged at 05100000 / 05110000.

## Not checked by a person

- No one has seen it in a window, played it with a pad or keyboard, or heard it. Pictures and WAVs from headless runs
  only. The launcher's pictures were taken with no window.
- Online play compiles but has never been tried (its service is cps2recomp's; the lobby is keyed by `sfiii3`).
- The VS screen shows horizontal stripes: probably the game's wipe, not checked against the board.
